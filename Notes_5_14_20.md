# Usage Notes: 5/14/20:

On Tuesday, May 12, 2020, I wound up using the Transcriber Aide. This was the part of transcription that actually went the smoothest. I was able to  get 30 entries done in three hours. The only things to note about the Aide are I had to use the "Paste and Match Style" (aka ```Cmd+Shift+V``` on macOS) in order to paste the the block of text that consisted of 'Name, Phone, and Message' into the e-mail. The reasoning should be obvious, but I think I'll have to use it for the piecemeal parts that are pasted into the Google Sheets document. When I paste into that it increases the font size. I should probably I should note that there were issues with transcription that were unrelated to the Aide itself. These are probably the reasons that transcription took three hours. They consisted of:

- I wanted to use an extension to listen to the audio files that I would transcribe without having to leave Chrome. Apparenlty there are none, at least none that anyone could recommend. 

- The program I normally use to listen to said audio files, VLC, was having issues; if one has to play/pause often, the audio drops out and the program freezes. This seemed to be an issue on macOS with version 3.0.10. A quick fix for this is to install an earlier version of VLC (the previous one being 3.0.8). Which I did.
